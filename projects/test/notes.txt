- setup.py -> With Distutils, this file provide metadata needed for creating a module distribution for
our module. With this file, you can run "python setup.py sdist" to create a tar or zip file used for
future module installation. After unpacking that file, a user of the module can install it via "python
setup.py install". This should go to a folder responsible for housing third-party modules, but I will have
to play with it to see what happens on my end.
- Distribute - not used anymore #nice

- nose -> used for unit testing but may be abandoned in the near future
"http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
- virtualenv -> creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that share libraries with
other virtualenv environments (addressing issues of dependencies and version, and indirect permissions)
